      how mainstream maths education enslaves minds
    </h1>
    
    <p>the mythological equivalent of a cat, a ferengi, and a human walk into a classroom.</p>

    <p>
      the <i>teacher</i> says:
      "If you follow these steps in this order you will be able to multiply correctly"
    </p>

    <p>
      the <i>cat</i> multiplies three by two and then declares that the result is seven as she has never liked six so she skipped it;
      she doesn't care what the teacher thinks
    </p>

    <p>
      the <i>ferengi</i> notices that by multiplying two times three times two times three times two times three times two times three you get a lot more latinum.
      she doesn't share this with anyone because she has been taught that women shouldn't have ideas.
      profits suffer.
      (a male ferengi also wouldn't share it with anyone but he might profit from it later)
    </p>

    <p>
      the <i>human</i> notices the <i>cat</i> and the <i>ferengi</i>.<br />
      (she also notices a <i>dog</i> who is hastily scribbling an incorrect but adorably close copy of what is on the board into their notes).<br />
      the <i>human</i> also has a <i>computer</i>.
    </p>

    <p>`<code>node</code>`, she says to the <i>computer</i></p>

    <p>
      `<code>Welcome to Node.js v12.18.3.\n
      Type ".help" for more information.\n
      &gt;</code>`,

      the <i>computer</i> replies a vanishingly small number of milliseconds later.
    </p>

    <p>`<code>2 * 3</code>`, she says</p>

    <p>`<code>6\n&gt;</code>`</p>

    <p>the `<code>teacher</code>` takes the computer and explains that in this class they will learn to do this themselves</p>

    <p>no student is allowed to succeed and they never learn who they are</p>
